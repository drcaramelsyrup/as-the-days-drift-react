	You recognize him right away when he steps through the door, though, once he's taken off his raincoat and given it a good shake. His hair looks neater, and he's got a slightly thicker chin, but he's still got the boxy jaw and almond-shaped eyes, his mother's straight dark hair. He looks around. He's scanning. He sweeps his eyes across your section, by the windows, but he doesn't seem to notice you. It's not as if you're unsearchable on the Internet.

[[You raise your hand to get his attention.->intro_3_hand]]
[[You call out to him.->intro_3_call]]
[[You try texting him instead.->intro_3_text]]
[[Just wait, you think. He'll notice you eventually.->intro_3_wait]]

:: intro_3_hand
A waiter, about to make his way back to the kitchen, turns and comes over, mouth slightly open in an "O" of anticipation.

[[You apologize and dismiss him.->intro_3_hand_1]]
[[You call out Cole's name.->intro_3_hand_1]]
[[You try waving your hand more fervently.->intro_3_hand_2]]

	Cole looks around for the source of the voice. When he finds you, his eyes widen into bright globes.

	[[You stay seated.->intro_3_seat]]

:: intro_3_text
> wait what
> You're here?
	He's typing on his phone. But finally he notices your well-lit table and expectant figure, his eyes widening into bright globes.
	"Hey," he says at the table, grinning.
	
	[[You embrace, like you used to.->intro_3_embrace]]
	[[You get up to shake his hand.->intro_3_shake]]
	[[You stay seated.->intro_3_seat]]

:: intro_3_wait
	It takes a disturbingly long time for him to register your face. At last his eyes widen into bright globes, and he hurries to your table.
	"Hey," he says, with a grin.
	
	[[You embrace, like you used to.->intro_3_embrace]]
	[[You get up to shake his hand.->intro_3_shake]]
	[[You stay seated.->intro_3_seat]]

:: intro_3_hand_1
	"Ah," the waiter says, understanding.
	He goes to grab the searching man at the entrance. Once he taps him on the shoulder and points to your table, Cole's eyes widen into bright globes.
	He makes his way over. "Hey," he says, and grins.
	
	[[You embrace, like you used to.->intro_3_embrace]]
	[[You get up to shake his hand.->intro_3_shake]]
	[[You stay seated.->intro_3_seat]]

:: intro_3_hand_2
	The waiter comes over with alarming speed. Cole finally seems to notice your flailing beacon as well. When he walks over, the waiter awkwardly mutters some excuse and floats back to the counter.
	"Hey," Cole says. He grins.
	
	[[You embrace, like you used to.->intro_3_embrace]]
	[[You get up to shake his hand.->intro_3_shake]]
	[[You stay seated.->intro_3_seat]]

:: You've got on a smart sweater, after all.
	You take care in the way you dress. Maybe it's this he's noticing. Were you always like this?
	"You look the part. Of a successful person, you know. God, you were like, the most brilliant person I knew in this whole town." He shakes his head. "Funny how long we've known each other at this point. I still remember that time I dragged Chase's Super Nintendo over to your place. I still remember the time you dropped into the neighborhood!"
	Yes, plopped into the scene, a few blocks away from Cole.

:: If you came to work wearing anything less than a suit, you'd be harshly chastised.
	"Look at you." He smirks. "You cleaned up."
	
	[[That, you do.]]
	[[As if you were never clean to begin with.]]
	[[Hey, it's not your choice.]]

:: It's not like you have anything fancy on.
	You aren't forced to wear anything exceptional. You might take care in your dress, but it's pretty casual.
	"No. I mean, you're right," he says. "Uh. I mean, you just look good. Healthy."
	You're not sure if this is the right sort of compliment to give, but you thank him anyway.
	"Well, something's different," he says.

:: flashback1
	You first met before his parents split. Theirs was an all-consuming love that he and she twisted around their fists, pulling themselves together in a tight knot. They'd entwine their arms walking together, or he would sling his around her torso and tug her close, pinch her love handles, and she'd slip her hand under his shirt and tickle his belly. This, all in full view of Cole and everyone downtown. _cycle_parentresponse

	At their worst they were explosive, though you never personally witnessed this. His father would retreat into the bathroom and run the water in the sink for an hour. His mother would drink herself silly and want Cole to curl up beside her on the living room couch, in his father's stead.
<!--He'd leave the house in search of a quieter place (usually yours, or the library). He wouldn't say much.

	_cycle_coping
	After so many attempts at piecing together their delicate relationship only to have it shattered in their son's face, they finally split, when Cole was around fourteen. Cole told you, later, at his mom's (most of the time he lived at his father's, thirty minutes from school), that it was "not big news or anything."

:: intro_3_embrace
	He pulls you in. He smells like burnt coffee and generic aftershave.
	He smiles at you when you sit down. The waiter hands Cole a menu. "I can't believe it's been so long," Cole says. He lets out a satisfied sigh.
	"Wow," Cole says. "I really didn't recognize you when I came in." He takes you in.

	"So," Cole says.
	
	[[So.->So]]
	[[How is he?]]
	[[What took him so long to find you?]]
	[[It's been too long.]]

:: intro_1
	It had been years since you last talked with him, but now Cole, the friend of your childhood, still hopelessly ensnared in his hometown and family plight, unable to join you among the ranks of the college-educated elite, was eager to get in touch with you. 
	Of course you kept in contact through Facebook and whatnot. Aside from remote communication, it was no longer prudent to meet up. Cole got a job where he could take care of his parents, and you were being educated.
	[[Then he comes in.->intro_2]]

:: So
	"Wow, uh," Cole says. "I really didn't recognize you when I came in." He leans back in his chair, takes you in.

[[You've got on a smart sweater, after all.]]
[[If you came to work wearing anything less than a suit, you'd be harshly chastised.]]
[[It's not like you have anything fancy on.]]

:: How is he?
	"Good, good. Really, uh," he says. "Fine."
	He nods.
	"How about yourself? I mean," he scoffs, "I really didn't recognize you." He leans back in his chair and takes you in.
	
[[You've got on a smart sweater, after all.]]
[[If you came to work wearing anything less than a suit, you'd be harshly chastised.]]
[[It's not like you have anything fancy on.]]

:: What took him so long to find you?
	"I mean, look at you," he says, laughing.
	"You, like, uh," he intones, and laughs again, scratches the back of his head. "I mean, I really didn't recognize you." He takes you in now, leaning back in his chair.
	
[[You've got on a smart sweater, after all.]]
[[If you came to work wearing anything less than a suit, you'd be harshly chastised.]]
[[It's not like you have anything fancy on.]]

:: It's been too long.
	"Yeah," he says, nodding deeply.
	He's silent for a moment, then gives a short laugh.
	"Wow," he says. "I really didn't recognize you."
	
[[You've got on a smart sweater, after all.]]
[[If you came to work wearing anything less than a suit, you'd be harshly chastised.]]
[[It's not like you have anything fancy on.]]

:: That, you do.
	"Now, don't get ahead of yourself," he chides. "I'd hate for you to look like one of those generic corporate people in a few years."
	He chuckles, then clasps his hands together. "Not that that would happen, of course. I'm kidding."
	The waiter brings over a carafe and fills both your glasses with water.
	"Anyway, Christ, how are you? It has been ages. What, like fifteen years? Since you dropped into the neighborhood, I mean. We've known each other for so long."
	How much has changed, especially in that boy across from you.
	
	[[You first met before his parents split.->flashback1]]

:: As if you were never clean to begin with.
	"Come on. It was high school. It was a pretty messed up time," he says. "I don't think anyone really knew what they were doing. Or at least, I didn't."
	He waves a hand as if he were swatting a fly. "God, yeah, we've known each other for just about forever, you realize that? It's been almost fifteen years since you moved here."
	It has. How much has changed, over the years, especially in the boy sitting in front of you.
	
	[[You first met before his parents split.->flashback1]]

:: Hey, it's not your choice.
	"Sure, sure. But you do look good in those threads, just saying. Don't you feel good?" He eyes the cut of your cloth.
	"Anyway, Christ, yeah, it's been years since we talked. You realize we've known each other for almost fifteen years? Since that day you dropped into the neighborhood? How are you?"
	He's right. How long it's been since you moved here. How much has changed, especially in the boy across from you.
	
	[[You first met before his parents split.->flashback1]]

:: different
	"No, no. I mean, you look great. Fantastic. But as a whole, you just look so much more put together, you know? Like a real on-top-of-their-shit person. That's hard to do nowadays."
	He laughs. "I'm sorry, it's just been a while. Since we've talked face-to-face, in real life. I mean, Christ, it's been ages since that day you dropped in the neighborhood."
	Fifteen years ago, yes, you plopped into this quiet town. How much has changed, especially in the boy sitting across from you.
	
	[[You first met before his parents split.->flashback1]]

:: flashback1_2
	When Cole's parents finally split, they sat him down to have the talk. Afterwards, they leaned forward intently and he asked, "So who am I staying with?"
	Later that evening his dad retreated to the bedroom and his mother sat on the couch where he had, staring at her palms. He sat opposite her, and she said she was trying to imagine what this was like for him. He said it was about time, and honestly it was such a relief after so long. Then his mother started crying and asked him if he would forgive them for doing such a shitty job of making a loving family.
	He watched her cry for a long time. He got up and sat next to her, and they stayed like that. _cycle_give Then he turned on the TV. This smiling woman was selling 1-carat, 2-carat diamond rings. They watched the rings shimmer grossly on her perfectly-manicured fingers. His mother shook her head.

:: flashback1_3
	(if: $var_tv_response is "remember")[	They shuffled through the drawers of cooking paraphenalia in the kitchen and uncovered the vegetable peelers and a school cookbook, with recipes sent in by parents of everyone in the second grade class. They decided to bake the oatmeal cookies she sent in. While mixing the dough Cole stuck a finger in the bowl and offered the sweet, honeyed mash to his mother. She smacked her lips and dipped in her finger before flicking it on his cheek. She howled as he flicked a bunch in her eye, and she had to say "Timeout."
	"Oh god, my contacts," she said. She bent over laughing, and Cole laughed himself to the floor. Finally he helped her take them out. The two of them realized there were clumps of oats all around them. His mother shrugged and reached up to take the bowl and offered him more. They wiped the bowl with their fingers and licked them clean as they sat on the greasy floor. Finally his mother said to let her clean this mess up. There was school tomorrow. "Go on then," she said.
	He fell asleep to the sounds of clinking pots and pans being pushed back into place.]
	(if: $var_tv_response is "order")[	"Hang up that phone," she cried. "Your father barely has the money for the mortgage next month. Hang up that thing."
	"And, and," Cole said, putting a finger to his lips, "a necklace. The one encrusted with all that stuff. Yeah, the gold." She blinked at him, speechless. "Yeah, I know, I really messed up this time. I... lost her Pontiac. I mean, it was a long night, so. Well, it's actually for my mother. She has, or had, three in the garage, takes care of them better than her own son. Right? Yeah, sounds great. Yes, the 2-carat." Tinsely holiday music trickled out the receiver along with an overly solemn organ. He hung up. When he looked back to his mother she had her mouth open. "They'll be shipping it over in a week or so. I got a great deal." He couldn't stop the grin from tearing at his mouth.
	"Oh," she said, giving him a shove. "You little dick."
	"You know it."
	"The poor salesman."
	"Saleswoman, actually. She thought it was really sweet."
	"You sounded like a right ass."
	"Lots at school. I learn from the best."
	His mother laughed easily and often. They got back on the couch and flipped through the shopping channels. She saw a bike she wanted to get him when he was eight, a garish orange contraption, but they had to settle something with the electric company and it got lost in the midst of the kerfuffle. This time she dialed and spoke and talked about her little son, and how cute he was, and how he could ditch his bike with the rusted brakes now. She spoke about their German shepherd, and how he'd join them for outings in the park on Saturdays until the salesperson finally finished filling out her personal info and hastily transferred and then she hung up.
	"Your turn," she said.
	That night they bought a polishing set for her grandfather's old hunting rifles and a fake Christmas tree with the lights pre-strung because they were going to have a holiday fête with Schwarzeneggers and a 1/3-sized model of the human brain because he was going to medical school next fall. At the end of it all his mother was about to smother him for all the bullshit her son was spouting. He pushed away her knees as he tried to buy an armoire for the Secretary of State and when the salesman promptly hung up, she clasped his hand still on his kneecap and laughed into a dusty cushion.
	They stayed like that until his father pushed open the bedroom door with a creak. Then they were timid with their hands clammed up in front of them while he asked what was going on. It's late and he and she and Cole all had to get up early tomorrow. Wordlessly they went their separate ways. In the morning Cole saw the phone by the couch and moved it back into its proper place.]
