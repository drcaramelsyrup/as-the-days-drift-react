I got a great deal.\" He couldn't stop the grin from tearing at his mouth.\n\t\"Oh,\" she said, giving him a shove. \"You little dick.\"\n\t\"You know it.\"\n\t\"The poor salesman.\"\n\t\"Saleswoman, actually. She thought it was really sweet.\"\n\t\"You sounded like a right ass.\"\n\t\"Lots at school. I learn from the best.\"\n\tHis mother laughed easily and often. They got back on the couch and flipped through the shopping channels. She saw a bike she wanted to get him when he was eight, a garish orange contraption, but they had to settle something with the electric company and it got lost in the midst of the kerfuffle. This time she dialed and spoke and talked about her little son, and how cute he was, and how he could ditch his bike with the rusted brakes now. She spoke about their German shepherd, and how he'd join them for outings in the park on Saturdays until the salesperson finally finished filling out her personal info and hastily transferred and then she hung up.\n\t\"Your turn,\" she said.\n\tThat night they bought a polishing set for her grandfather's old hunting rifles and a fake Christmas tree with the lights pre-strung because they were going to have a holiday f\u00eate with Schwarzeneggers and a 1/3-sized model of the human brain because he was going to medical school next fall. At the end of it all his mother was about to smother him for all the bullshit her son was spouting. He pushed away her knees as he tried to buy an armoire for the Secretary of State and when the salesman promptly hung up, she clasped his hand still on his kneecap and laughed into a dusty cushion.\n\tThey stayed like that until his father pushed open the bedroom door with a creak. Then they were timid with their hands clammed up in front of them while he asked what was going on. It's late and he and she and Cole all had to get up early tomorrow. Wordlessly they went their separate ways. In the morning Cole saw the phone by the couch and moved it back into its proper place."
